# ðŸ“Š EDA: Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis

This video from CampusX (Day 21 of 100 Days of ML) explores how variables interact in a dataset. Learn to perform bivariate analysis using scatter plots, box plots, and count plots, and dive into multivariate analysis with pair plots and heatmaps. Understand relationships between features, detect patterns, spot outliers, and handle multicollinearity â€” all before modeling. This step is crucial for meaningful insights and smarter machine learning workflows. If univariate plots were chapter 1, this is where the plot thickens.
